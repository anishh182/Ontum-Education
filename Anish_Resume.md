**PROJECTS**

• **Project 1 (Major Project)**

Title: Sneaker App using Object Detection and Computer Vision

Description: Using object detection I created “SneakScan”, the SneakScan feature enables user

to use their phone and scan any sneaker to get all the information about it along with links to

external website for purchase.

Tools used: Google Colab, OpenCV, YoloV5, WebScraper

Learning Outcome: This project enabled me to learn the working of object detection by OpenCV.

• **Project 2 (Mini Project)**

Title: Stock Market Prediction

Description: This was thprediction model which takes data from the previous and makes

predictions on the outcome of the next month. The parameters used were Volume, Selling Price,

Open, High, Low, Close. I implemented Naïve Bayes algorithm, Linear regressions and Decision

trees algorithm for the predictions.

Tools used: Google Colab, Investing.com, Kaggle

Learning Outcome: I was able to understand and implement Naïve Bayes, Linear Regression and

Decision tree algorithms.
