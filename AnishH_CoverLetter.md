

Respected Sir/Madam,

Machine Learning and AI have taken the world by storm and with the help of your company I

would love to get into the field, so I Anish Hungund a 3rd year engineering student from

CMR Institute of Technology would like to work along side your esteemed ML engineers.

I started my machine learning journey back in mid-2020 with a simple Stock Market

prediction model which uses regression algorithms to detect change in the pre-existing data I

gave to produce results for the upcoming financial month.

I further read a few articles and got very intrigued by Image processing and object detection,

so I started my work on an object detection model. Since I fancy sneakers very much, I made

a model to recognize different sneakers from my database and provide links and information

about the sneaker being detected.

Coming to my present work, I am currently working with VAEs (Variational autoencoders)

to build a model that produces its own classical music, though it is still a work in progress the

outputs are quite promising.
I have extensively worked with ReactJS during my internship in AlgoDrive Solutions where i created 5 screens which included the login and sign up pages with all the necessary functions. I am currently moving towards Django to help imporve my skill and move into Full Stack Development. 

When it comes to my work experience, I interned at FRNT labs for a short period where we

worked with image processing again to detect anomalies in images but my work mainly

involved data annotation and classification.

After my period with FRNT Labs I went on to intern at Grroom: Fashion AI company which

makes finding your desired fit of clothing in just a few clicks. We extensively used the

YoloV3 model for image recognition and processing.

AlgoDrive is an AI based tutoring platform which uses the inputs from the student

performances and enables systematic and proficient learning of the course they have chosen.

This internship also enabled me to enhance my skills in front end development by using tools

like ReactJS, NodeJS and Express to name a few. With the experience of the MongoDB

backend.

My knowledge in this field is moderate but I would love to dive deep and learn more about

machines and how we can change the future. I hope to be a good addition to your team with

good insights and quick problem solving.

I would love to work for your company as it would greatly help me understand machine

learning on a different scope and level, and I also hope to become a major part of the

company's growth. I am hard-working, diligent and honest, you can put your faith in me to

fulfil the job punctually and cordially.

Sincerely,

Anish H Hungund
